# projectproposal
Student council officers often have a lot of paper works. Proposals from different clubs take up a huge percentage of those paper works. 
Club members also benefit from the system as they can see real-time updates of their proposal's progress. The project proposal system was made to digitize the traditional way of managing proposals.
